#### Statistical Model to estimate flood risk in NYC

**Assumptions**

- local sea level is affected only by tidal variations, storm surge, and changes to the long-term mean.

- use different fixed values of the tide level and storm surge

- all other sea level variations follow a normal (Gaussian distribution)

**Key variables** (meter)

1. tidal variations

  - zero point is halfway between the high and low tide level
  
  - ranges from -1.25 to 1.25 m
  
  - use high tide level 1.25m and high tide level -1.25 m to model flood risks

2. storm surge

  - 1 m 
  
  - 2 m 
  
  - 3 m

3. changes to the long-term mean, which are caused by climate change (combining RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5)



4. background variations
